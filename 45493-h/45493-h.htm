<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">There</span> is no difficulty in the learned writing for
the learned, but it is extremely difficult to compose
a work for the instruction of the ignorant.
The more comprehensive and exact knowledge the writer
has of his subject the more arduous is the effort to
express his thoughts in such simplicity as will make it
understandable to those who have little or no knowledge
of the subject he treats. This is doubly so when the
subject is one like sailing&mdash;an art whose language is
wholly technical and almost totally divorced from the
common expressions of life. It is impossible to translate
sea language into land language; nor is it possible
to explain the conditions and operations of the art without
employing sea terms.</p>

<p>In this work I have endeavored to avoid as far as is
possible the employment of intricate or obscure technical
language, and where it is used have endeavored to
explain the meaning and define the application. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
book is intended for the use of persons who are supposed
to be altogether ignorant of the art of sailing.
It is a primer and, therefore, is almost absurdly simple
and profuse in explanatory details. But my experience
as a teacher has taught me that such books cannot be
too simple, and that in order to be understandable they
must be loaded with explanations of explanations until
nothing is left to explain. To those who know, this
will seem unnecessary, but it must be remembered that
many who will learn from this book, have not only
never handled a sailing boat, but have never seen one
before, and have but extremely crude notions of how
the canvas and helm are employed to drive and direct
them.</p>

<p>In regard to the glossary: The definitions given are
those that define the terms as used in sailing or navigating
small craft, and may have a different meaning
when applied to larger vessels. It is very difficult to
exactly define many nautical terms, as they are words
in action, and consequently present different phases,
as they are differently employed. In many cases only
one who is a trained seaman can comprehend their exact
purport or understand their significant application.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="SPECIAL_REMARKS" id="SPECIAL_REMARKS"></a>SPECIAL REMARKS</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> first question before you start to learn to sail is:
Do you know how to swim? If you don’t, you
have no business in a sailing boat&mdash;in fact you
have no business on the water. No parent should allow
his boy or girl to have a sailboat until they have learned
to swim. It is not difficult to learn to swim; any child
can be taught that art in ten days, and it should be a
compulsory course in all our schools. If people knew
how to swim, nine-tenths of the drowning accidents that
do happen would not. Every summer a large number
of young people are drowned in this country through
the overturning of boats or by falling overboard. Had
these persons been taught to swim the majority of them
would not have been drowned. A person who can swim
has confidence. If suddenly thrown in the water he or
she retain their presence of mind, but if unable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
swim they become panic stricken, and are not only
drowned but in their struggles frequently drown others.</p>

<p>Another custom prolific of accident on the water is
the overloading of boats. The green hand should be
warned against this practice. Never take a lot of people
out in a boat, particularly a sailboat; especially do not
take out women and children, or men who are not
familiar with boats.</p>

<p>Another thing, never play the fool in a boat. A man
who with others in a boat plays such tricks as rocking
or trying to carry large sail in a breeze, climbing a
mast, or any other silly stunt, is a fool, and is not
fit to be trusted with any sort of a craft.</p>

<p>A properly designed and well-constructed boat is
perfectly safe in the hands of a sensible person, and
if properly used be made to give pleasure not only to
the owner but to others. Sailing is one of the safest
of our sports; very few yachtsmen lose their lives while
boating. It is nothing like so dangerous a sport as
bicycling, automobiling or carriage driving. I have met
thousands of yachtsmen during my long service in the
sport, but of all my acquaintances I can only recall one
who was drowned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="GENERAL_REMARKS" id="GENERAL_REMARKS"></a>GENERAL REMARKS</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">If</span> you are going to learn to sail get a small boat.
Men who learn in large boats seldom become good
helmsmen. Another thing, do not learn in what
is called a non-capsizable boat; get a boat that can be
upset. The modern outside ballast, non-capsizable, finkeel
or semi-finkeel, is a very easy vessel to handle, and
it requires very little skill to sail them; as a fact, you
don’t sail them; you simply steer them. The old-fashioned,
inside ballast, capsizable, long-keel craft was
a very different proposition, and it required considerable
skill to handle such properly. It is for this reason
that the best sailors we have ever had graduated from
the helms of that type of boat.</p>

<p>The best boat for a boy to get to learn in is one of
not more than twenty feet length; a fifteen-footer is
better. She should be half-decked, and be of such construction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
and weight that even if filled she will float.
It is better to have a boat that requires little or no ballast.
If in a place where the water is generally smooth, the
Lark type is an excellent craft to learn in; if where it
is rough, get one of those cheap sailing dories. <span class="smcap">The
Rudder</span> Skip is also a good boat, but is somewhat more
expensive. Another good boat for a beginner is a 15-foot,
half-decked, cat-rigged boat; a boat with considerable
freeboard and a water-tight cockpit. Such a boat
can be built in first-class style for about $250 or $300.
I strongly advise the beginner to use the cat rig, no
matter what type of hull he employs.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>Many begin in a rowboat, fitted with a sail. These
are generally poor craft, not being of the proper form
for sailing. While they will do, if nothing better can
be had, they are far inferior to a properly designed sailing
dory or a Lark. If the beginner starts in a poor
sailing craft he is apt to get disgusted with the results
of his work and give up.</p>

<p>After you have learned to handle a boat under cat
rig you can get one with a jib, and learn to sail the
more complicated rig. It is not best at first to go in
for too many sails, as it means much more gear and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>this is apt to confuse the beginner, and make the task
of learning harder.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

  <div class="figcaption">
    <p>DIAGRAM A.&mdash;DECK PLAN OF YACHT.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>By starting to learn to sail in a capsizable boat you
will gather the first and most important part of sailorizing,
and that is caution, and you will gain from sailing
such a boat that nicety of touch which is the acme of
helming skill, and which can never be acquired in an
uncapsizable craft. Knowing that inattention to your
work will perhaps result in a spill, you will be constantly
on the alert, and you will learn that by quick
and proper movements of the helm you can control and
maneuvre your boat so as to keep her on her bottom
at all times.</p>

<p>If you have your boat ready take a day when the
wind is light and steady and get somebody to go with
you who understands sailing. Let the old hand tend
the sheet while you handle the tiller. Then sail up
and down in a quiet place until you get confidence in
the boat and in yourself. This will soon come when
you find that you can perform the different sailing
maneuvres. It is a good plan after you have the hang
of handling the tiller to choose a mark to windward,
and to start and beat up to it, then turn the mark and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>run back again. Repeat this several times as it will
give you practice in sailing both on and off the wind.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <a name="offthewind" id="offthewind"><img src="images/illus-015.jpg" width="459" height="600" alt="Off the wind" /></a>
  <div class="figcaption">
    <p>OFF THE WIND.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>If the wind is strong and you feel afraid of the boat,
don’t go out, but wait until the conditions are more
favorable to have your first try. If you get afraid or
rattled, as it is called, by the boat getting a knockdown
in a puff, just let her come up in the wind and rest, and
you will see that she is perfectly safe, and your courage
will soon return.</p>

<p>I have taught many&mdash;both boys and girls&mdash;to sail, and
I always put them right at the helm, and insist upon
them staying there. If they get in a tight place the
beginner will generally want to give up the helm. At
such a time I make them retain it, and by a little judicious
advice and a few words of encouragement get them
through the difficulty. This at once instills confidence.
One of my favorite tricks is when the green hand is
approaching the shore on a tack to leave him and go
below, pretending to pay no attention to his actions.
If he is good for anything, he will when the right time
arrives go about. Once he has done this by himself he
is confident, and will not hesitate to do it again. This
is the principal thing to make a beginner understand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
that he must depend upon his own judgment and not
rely upon yours.</p>

<p>Some persons can never be taught to sail. They
can learn to steer perhaps, but never can learn to handle
a sailing boat. I have found that comparatively few
females can learn to sail, but when they have the sailor’s
instinct it is very strongly developed, and they make
excellent skippers. They are far more fearless than
men, and can invariably be relied upon to carry out
orders, even to the death.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_BOAT_AND_RIG" id="THE_BOAT_AND_RIG"></a>THE BOAT AND RIG</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Having</span> picked out the boat that best suits your
ideas and pocket, start right in and learn all
about her. Study out her rig, and learn the
proper names of everything from keel to truck. Nothing
sounds worse than to hear a man who is sailing a boat
call the ropes, spars, etc., by wrong names, and use in
speaking of the boat and her actions unnautical language.
One of the quickest and easiest ways to learn the nomenclature
of the boat is to build and rig a small model.
You will in this way not only learn the proper terms
but also get an understanding of how a boat is rigged.
The first lesson I had was in trying to re-rig a topsail
schooner, the model of an old U.&nbsp;S. man-of-war. I was
about seven or eight years old, but having the boat
mania stuck to the task, although it was long and difficult,
and at last, with the kind assistance of a lady,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>succeeded in completing the job. In this way I captured
at an early age a thorough knowledge of how to rig.
You need not make a block model, just step your mast
in a flat board.</p>

  <div class="figcaption">

  </div>
</div>

<p>If you are going to buy a boat, not having the opportunity
to borrow or steal one, look about for a good
second-hand craft. This if in fair condition will do to
start with, for you will, as soon as you have learned,
want a bigger and better one. If you can use tools, and
have the materials and space, I would advise building
your own boat, as by so doing you will gather knowledge
that will prove invaluable to you in your after days.
But don’t build from your own design. Such boats are
invariably failures. A man must have considerable
knowledge of boats before he can design a proper one.
A deal of money has been wasted, and many have
been sadly disheartened and made sick of the sport at
the outset because they have built a boat after their own
plans, and it has turned out a failure. If you are going
to build get one of <span class="smcap">The Rudder</span> <cite>How-to Books</cite>, and you
will from it be able to construct a good sailing craft for
a reasonable price, with the least amount of labor.</p>

<p>If you buy a boat be sure the hull is in good condition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and that the boat is not a heavy and consistent
leaker. Also, find out if the boat will sail on the wind,
for many small boats will not. If the hull is all right,
buy the boat. The condition of the sail and rigging
is not so important, as you can renew these for a few
dollars, and it is better to start off with a new sail and
first-class gear. A boat with old canvas and weather-wasted
gear will not be satisfactory, and it is better to
spend a few dollars and get these things right.</p>

<p>In rigging the boat use as few ropes as possible.
A green hand, like a canoeman, generally wants to
decorate his spars with all the strings he can get on, but
the less rope and the simpler tackles you use the easier
will it be to handle the craft.</p>

<p>Whatever you use be sure it is strong. Always use
the best cordage you can buy; the difference in price
per pound is only a few cents, but there is considerable
difference in the way the two kinds will work. A rope
used for running should render freely through the block.
To do this it must be soft and pliable. Use blocks with
a larger swallow than the rope size you intend to run
through them, then the rope won’t stick when it gets
swollen with dampness or rain.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_SIDES_AND_TACKS" id="THE_SIDES_AND_TACKS"></a>THE SIDES AND TACKS</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> sides of a boat have two sets of names, the use
of which is apt to confuse the green hand, but if
you once clearly understand how these terms are
applied you will experience no trouble in properly employing
them.</p>

<p>The right-hand side of a vessel when standing looking
toward the bow is called the <em>starboard</em> side.</p>

<p>The left-hand side of a vessel when standing looking
toward the bow is called the <em>port</em> side.</p>

<p>These names are permanent, and no matter which
way the boat is turned the starboard side is always the
starboard side and the port side always the port side.</p>

<p>The other names for the sides of a vessel are not
permanent, but are always changing, shifting from side
to side, as the boat is turned about. Their particular
position is determined by the direction of the wind.</p>

<p>These names are <em>lee side</em> and <em>weather side</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>The <em>weather side</em> is that side of a vessel upon which
the wind blows.</p>

<p>The <em>lee side</em> is that side of the vessel which is farthest
from the wind, and is, in a fore-and-aft rigged craft, the
side on which the sail is stretched.</p>

<p>Now you will understand that, in consequence of the
vessel turning round and presenting first one side to the
wind and then the other, these names are continually
shifting from side to side.</p>

<p>For instance, if the wind is blowing on the port&mdash;left-hand
side&mdash;that is the weather side, and the starboard&mdash;right-hand
side&mdash;is the lee side. Turning the vessel
round, so that the wind blows on the starboard side, that
becomes the weather side, and the port side becomes the
lee side.</p>

<p>Having these sides and their names clearly fixed in
your mind you will be able to understand what a tack is.</p>

<p>When a vessel is sailing on a wind we say she is on
the port tack or starboard tack, meaning the way she
is heading in regard to the direction of the wind. This
tack is determined by the side upon which the wind blows.</p>

<p>A vessel is on the starboard tack when the wind
strikes upon her starboard side and the boom of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
mainsail is over on the port side. The reverse of this
puts her on the port tack.</p>

<p>Or, to be more concise, when the starboard side is the
weather side the boat is on the starboard tack. When
the port side is the weather side the boat is on the port
tack.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_HELM" id="THE_HELM"></a>THE HELM</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">A boat</span> or any vessel is steered by a contrivance
called a rudder, which is hung like a door on
hinges, and swings freely from side to side. This
rudder is moved by a handle called a tiller, which is
attached to the post and projects forward into the boat.
The whole apparatus for steering the boat is called the
helm, but in this chapter, when we speak of the helm,
it must be understood to mean the <em>tiller</em>.</p>

<p>When the helm is put, i.&nbsp;e., pushed in one direction,
the rudder moves in the other. For instance, if the helm
is turned to the right the rudder moves to the left, and
vice versa. The result of such a movement of the helm
is to turn the boat’s bow in the direction the rudder
points, so that the boat’s bow, or head as we say, turns
the opposite way to the way the tiller is pushed. Remember,
that if you put the helm to the left the boat’s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>head will turn to the right; if you put the helm to the
right it will turn to the left.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <a name="shoaldraughtsloop" id="shoaldraughtsloop"><img src="images/illus-027.jpg" width="427" height="600" alt="Shoal-draught sloop" /></a>
  <div class="figcaption">
    <p>SHOAL-DRAUGHT SLOOP.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The left side of the boat, as I have explained, is
always called the port side; therefore, if I order you to
put your helm to <em>port</em> you must push the tiller toward
the left. This will move the rudder toward the starboard
side, and as the boat’s bow moves the same way
as the rudder it will also move to starboard.</p>

<p>But in a sailing vessel, when going under canvas, we
do not usually order the helm to be put to starboard or
port, but employ terms that derive their signification
from the direction of the wind under whose influence
the vessel is moving. These terms are <em>up</em> and <em>down</em>,
and <em>a-lee</em> and <em>a-weather</em>.</p>

<p>To put the helm <em>up</em> you push the tiller toward the
side of the boat on which the wind is blowing. This
causes the vessel to move her head away from the wind&mdash;to
<em>fall off</em>, as it is called.</p>

<p>To put the helm <em>down</em> you push the tiller toward the
side on which the sail is. This causes the vessel to move
her head toward the wind&mdash;to <em>luff</em>, as it is called.</p>

<p>The easiest way to fix these two actions in the wind
is this: When a boat is heeled, i.&nbsp;e., tipped, as she usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
is when sailing on the wind, the helm is put up by
moving it toward the high or up side, and it is put down
by moving it toward the low or down side.</p>

<p>To put the helm <em>a-weather</em> is the same as putting it
<em>up</em>, or toward the weather side of the boat. To put the
helm <em>a-lee</em> is the same as putting it <em>down</em> or toward the
lee side of the boat.</p>

<p><em>Up&mdash;a-weather.</em></p>

<p><em>Down&mdash;a-lee.</em></p>

<p>The green hand must get the above information
firmly fixed in his mind, as it will save him lots of future
trouble. I have met men who have sailed for years who
confuse these orders through not thoroughly understanding
what they mean.</p>

<p>You will frequently hear a man when conning the
helm of a boat&mdash;that is, directing the steering&mdash;tell the
helmsman to <em>keep off</em>, meaning by that to put the helm
up and cause the boat to move further away from the
wind or course which the boat has been holding; or else
he will order the helmsman to <em>luff</em>, meaning for him to
put the helm down, and bring the boat’s bow nearer to
the wind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>The order to <em>steady</em> or <em>right</em> the helm means to bring
the tiller amidships, or in such position that it does not
influence the boat in either direction.</p>

<p>Large boats are steered by a wheel, which is simply
an apparatus used to give additional power, so that the
helm can be turned easily; but as we are dealing with
small boats using a tiller, we will not bother at present
to understand its working.</p>

<h2><a name="SAILING_ON_THE_WIND" id="SAILING_ON_THE_WIND"></a>SAILING ON THE WIND</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Sailing</span> on the wind, or by the wind, or close-hauled,
is a purely mechanical action, the motion
being the result of opposing two forces, the wind
pressure and the water pressure. The wind pressing
on the canvas forces the boat sideways, her form
causes the water to resist this movement, and as it
is easier for her to progress in the direction of her length
she moves that way. Her sails being arranged so as to
transfer this movement in the direction of the bow, she
moves ahead. It is to prevent her going sideways that
a boat is given a keel or centerboard.</p>

<p>In sailing to windward a boat’s sails are trimmed flat&mdash;that
is, the sheet is hauled in until the foot of the sail
lies nearly parallel to the line of the keel. How close to
being parallel depends largely upon the form of the hull,
an easily driven model being able to sail with a flatter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
sheet than one of coarser dimensions. No rule can be
laid down for trimming the sheets of a boat when sailing
on the wind, it depending upon the form of the vessel,
the strength of the wind, and the condition of the water.</p>

<p>As the movement of the boat is dependent upon the
pressure exerted upon her canvas by the wind, it is
necessary that the wind strike the sail on one side and
fill it, and that it exert this pressure in a constant manner.
Therefore, the boat’s bow cannot be kept pointing in the
direction of the wind, but must be made to approach
it at an angle. This angle, in a good sailing vessel,
is one of 45 degrees, or four points by compass.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that the wind is blowing from the
North. Now, if the boat’s bow is pointed North the current
of air will pass along both sides of her sail and exert
no pressure upon the canvas, acting just as it does upon
the fly of a flag. But if we turn her head slowly round
to the West we will find that the breeze begins to press
on the canvas, gradually filling it until when her bow is
pointed Northwest, or four points away from the wind,
the whole sail will be distended with pressure. She is
now said to be on a tack or board, and will move ahead
in the direction Northwest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

  </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>But let us suppose that the point we wish to reach is
directly North. If we continue sailing on this Northwest
tack we can never reach it. In order to do so we
must have the boat move in another direction. Four
points, or forty-five degrees, on the other side of North
is the direction Northeast. If our boat will fill her sail
with a North wind when pointed Northwest she will
also necessarily fill it when pointed Northeast. But
how are we to get her into a position so that she will
point Northeast? By performing a maneuvre which is
called <em>tacking</em> or <em>going about</em>.</p>

<p>To do this we put the helm down, or a-lee&mdash;that is,
push the tiller toward the side on which the sail is, the
rudder going in the opposite direction. In consequence
of this the boat’s bow begins to move toward the North.
As it does so the wind leaves the sail, the canvas shakes,
and then as her head swings past North the sail begins
to fill again, with the breeze on the opposite side, until
when she at last points Northeast it is rap full once
more. That is what is called tacking a vessel.</p>

<p>If we continue to tack, remaining for an equal distance
on each board or leg, the boat will gradually approach the
North point by a zig-zag movement, until she reaches it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes, owing to the wind not being directly
ahead, we are able to remain longer on one tack than on
the other. This is what is called making a long and
short leg.</p>

<p>To properly sail a boat on the wind requires constant
and minute attention to the helm and the canvas. The
best way for the new hand is to sit low down in the
cockpit to leeward of the tiller; this places him nearly
under the boom. Let him look up and watch his sail
just at the throat; here is where it will shake first. To
sail the boat close he must just keep that portion of the
sail shaking&mdash;or lifting as it is termed. After a few
days at this work he will get so that he can tell instinctively
by the feel of the boat just where she is, and will be
able to keep her close without constantly watching the
luff. Some skippers sail a boat by the jib luff, sitting
to windward to see it; others by the feel of the wind on
the face. This is a good guide at night when you cannot
see the sail. But those things will come to the novice
in time.</p>

<p>You should constantly practice altering the sheets of
your boat, until you find out under which trim she goes
best. You can mark the positions of the sheets by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
inserting between the strands of the rope a bit of colored
worsted; also alter the position of the weights, either
ballast or live, until you get the boat to her proper trim,
as this has much to do with a boat sailing well to windward.</p>

<p>If when trimmed to sail on the wind a boat shows
herself to be hard on the helm it may be the result of her
form, of the position of her ballast, or centerboard, or
through having too much after sail. If she gripes&mdash;that
is, tries to go up in the wind&mdash;slack off a little mainsheet,
and if she has a jib trim it flatter. If she tries to do the
other thing run off to leeward; ease the jib sheets. The
worst fault a boat can have is that of carrying a lee helm.
Never buy a slack-headed boat; they are an abomination.</p>

<p>In rough-water sailing a boat going to windward
wants her sheet eased. Do not trim the sails dead flat,
nor try to sail the boat very close to the wind; give her
what is called a <em>good full</em>, and keep her moving all the
time. Remember, that every wave is a hill that the
boat has to climb over, and she needs all the drive possible
in order to do it. You must learn how to help her with
the helm to take these seas easily, first by luffing and
then by bearing away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>A man can only become a good windward helmsman
by constant practice and by paying attention to every
detail. He must have a quick eye, a firm hand and plenty
of grit and strength.</p>

<h2><a name="SAILING_OFF_THE_WIND" id="SAILING_OFF_THE_WIND"></a>SAILING OFF THE WIND</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Sailing</span> off the wind, or going free, is a different
action from that of sailing on the wind. Sailing
free is purely a natural movement, complicated by
the fact that a vessel, owing to her weight obliging her to
rest in the water, cannot move as freely as a fabric wholly
sustained by the air. The fact that friction of the water
retards her so that she moves at a less speed than the wind
that presses her onward permits of her being steered.
Another complication that effects the speed of a vessel
going free is the unevenness of the water, the effect of
the wind raising surface waves; these greatly retard and
hamper her movements. If, instead of rising in waves
the sea remained smooth a sailing vessel could be driven
nearly as fast as the wind moves, as is the case with
ice boats, which on smooth ice move as fast as the wind.</p>

<p>In sailing to windward the faster a vessel moves the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
more pressure the wind exerts upon her sail. In sailing
to leeward this is just the reverse; the faster she goes the
less pressure the wind exerts. In the first action she is
constantly approaching the source of the wind, in the
second receding from it. For instance, if the wind is
blowing at the rate of 20 miles an hour and a vessel
sailing before it makes 10 miles an hour the pressure in
her sails will only be equal to a rate of 10 miles. In
calculating how much sail to carry the young yachtsman
must remember this: That a windward breeze is
nearly double the wind’s velocity, that a leeward breeze
is equal to the wind’s velocity minus the boat’s speed;
so that more sail can be carried off the wind that can be
carried on it.</p>

<p>The amount of sail that can be carried off the wind
depends largely upon the form of the boat and the
height and action of the sea. If the boat is of a good
form for running and the water smooth you can carry
all the sail her spars will stand and she can be steered
under. But if she is a bad runner, a boat that roots&mdash;goes
down by the head&mdash;or chokes up forward, she will
do better with less sail. On all boats there is a time
when they reach their maximum speed running and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
they will go along easier and better with less canvas.
To do her best when running a boat should be kept on
an even line&mdash;that is, level in the water, and not be
allowed to shove her head up or drop her stern down.</p>

<p>In straight stem boats with very little fullness in the
forward sections the weight of the crew should be kept
aft, as they have a tendency to root&mdash;shove their bows
down&mdash;but in boats with long, full overhangs the weights
should be kept forward, as the shape of these craft causes
them to shove out the bow and depress and drag the
after end.</p>

<p>The most difficult helming of a boat is off the wind
in a tall following sea, and great care is necessary then
in steering a vessel. If the sea is very heavy and the
wind strong do not try to run directly before it, but beat
to leeward, first taking the wind on one quarter, and then
on the other. If you run dead before, be careful not
to let the boat sheer off the helm on either side, or she
will be <em>brought by the lee</em> or <em>broach to</em>. If she is brought
by the lee her mainsail will jibe over.</p>

<p>You must watch your boat carefully, and you will
soon learn to anticipate her next movement, first by
noticing the wave that passes, and second by the feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
how she lifts on the one just overtaking her. As soon
as the stern lifts she will begin to yaw, as it is called,
and then you must at once check this movement by
altering the position of the rudder to prevent her swinging
too far. This is what is called <em>meeting her with the
helm</em>.</p>

<p>One piece of advice when running before a sea: Never
get frightened or rattled, and never look behind you,
for the sight of a big sea curling up just ready to drop
on the stern will scare any one but a hardened sea-dog.
Always carry enough sail to keep the boat racing
with the waves, or you are liable to get pooped.
But do not carry too much sail, for if you do the boat
when on top of a wave if struck, as she usually is in
such position by a hard puff, is likely to become unmanageable
and get away from you.</p>

<p>If you have a boat with a jib, set that and sheet it
flat amidships; this when she tries to broach to will fill
and drive her head off. If she steers hard trim your
mainsheet aft and it will ease her. Lowering the peak
and topping up the boom will also ease the steering.
Always top up the boom if the sea is heavy, so as to prevent
the end of the spar striking the water. Never in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
heavy weather square the main boom right off; always
keep it away from the rigging.</p>

<p>The light sails commonly employed off the wind are
the spinnaker and balloon jib. The former is of very
little use except with the wind dead aft&mdash;that is, directly
behind. The moment you have to guy the boom forward
to make it draw it loses its power and the balloon jib
is a better sail to use. Do not have these sails cut too
large, as they are then unhandy and cannot be kept
properly sheeted. Never sheet running sails down hard;
give them plenty of lift, especially light jibs. A small
spinnaker is a great help in steering a boat when running
before a strong breeze.</p>

<h2><a name="REEFING_AND_JIBING" id="REEFING_AND_JIBING"></a>REEFING AND JIBING</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">By</span> reefing is meant the means by which a sail is
reduced in size by rolling up and tying part of
it down to a spar. The sail that you will have
to reef is the mainsail, as the jib on a small boat is
generally too little to be bothered with in that way. You
will notice on a sail, stretching across it from luff to
leach, a band, or sometimes two or three bands, in which
are inserted short lengths of small line. This is the
reef band, and the small lengths of rope are called points,
or knittles. At either end of the band in the edge of the
sail you will find a hole&mdash;or cringle, as it is called. The
hole at the after end in the leach of the sail is for the
pendant, a small rope that hauls the canvas aft or back
towards the stern. The hole at the fore end in the luff
of the sail is for the tack, a short length of rope that
ties the luff of the sail down to the boom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>There are two ways of reefing. The first and easiest
way, which can be performed when the boat is at anchor
or lying to a dock, is to hoist the sail up until the reef
band is as high as the boom; then take the tack and pass
the ends round the boom, pass the ends back again
through the cringle several times, if it will go, and then
tie hard. Having the tack fast, haul out on the pendant,
which should be rove through a beehole or cheek block
on the boom; pull on this until the sail’s foot is out taut,
but do not pull until the cloth is strained. When the
foot is out taut make the pendant fast; then take a
short piece of rope and pass it round the boom and
pendant just at the cringle and through that hole.
Tie this down hard. This is called the <em>clew lashing</em>.
Always put on a clew lashing, as it will save the sail
from being torn.</p>

<p>Having the tack and pendant fast, begin to tie in the
points. Get all the slack canvas on one side and roll it
up tight; then pass one end of the reef point through
<em>between the lacing and the sail, not round the boom</em>.
Tie the point ends together with a bow knot, which is a
reef knot with the loop caught in the tie. Pull all your
points taut, but be sure and put the same strain on all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Begin to tie in the middle first, and then work toward
both ends.</p>

<p>To shake out a reef reverse these operations. First
untie the points, then the clew lashing, then slack in the
pendant, and last cast loose the tack lashing. Be careful
to untie all the points, because if you do not you are
liable to tear the sail when hoisting it. Before shaking
out a reef, if you have a topping lift fitted pull up on
that so as to take the weight of the boom off the sail.
If the air is damp, or rain or spray knocking about, don’t
haul the sail out very taut or tie the points down hard, as
the wet will cause the rope and canvas to shrink and
strain the sail out of shape. Never leave reefs tied in
sail when stowed, as the canvas will mildew and rot.</p>

<p>Jibing is the operation of passing a boom sail over
from one side of the boat to the other when sailing
off the wind. A great deal of nonsense has been written
and talked about jibing, and it is commonly supposed to
be a very dangerous maneuvre. So it is, if carried out
by incompetent persons or reckless fools in a bad boat,
but if common sense and caution are used there is no
danger whatever in jibing a sail at any time.</p>

<p>The first and most important thing is to keep control<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
of the sheet, and to have as little of it out as possible
when the sail goes over. In order to do this you must use
the helm with great care to bring the boat slowly round.
If it is blowing hard top up the boom and lower the
peak; in this way you can always safely jibe.</p>

<p>To jibe: Haul in the sheet slowly but steadily, and
when well aft carefully put the helm up until the wind
strikes the fore side of the sail. As the boom swings
across right the helm and then put it the other way, so
as to catch the boat as she swings off.</p>

<p>If you have to jibe all standing&mdash;what is called a
North River jibe&mdash;that is, with the sheet all off&mdash;just as
soon as boom goes over put your helm hard the other
way; this will throw the boat’s head so the wind
will strike the fore side of the sail and break the force
of the swing. It is a very dangerous method, unless you
are a skillful skipper, and should never be employed
except in an emergency. Never jibe in a seaway with
the sheet off; at such time it is better to lower the peak.</p>

<h2><a name="TAKING_CARE_OF_THE_BOAT" id="TAKING_CARE_OF_THE_BOAT"></a>TAKING CARE OF THE BOAT</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">You</span> must not only learn to sail, but you must learn
to take care of your boat, to keep her neat and
clean, and have everything above and below decks
in shipshape order. Nothing looks worse than a slovenly
kept and dirty yacht; a boat with fag ends of rope hanging
about, loose and tangled messes of gear, sails not
properly stowed, and a general air of untidiness apparent
everywhere. The first attribute of good seamanship is
order. Therefore, if you want to be considered a skillful
sailor, keep your boat both above and below decks in
shipshape fashion.</p>

<p>To do this means considerable work. It is no easy job
to take proper care of even a small yacht, but if you
regularly attend to the work you will find it come easier
as you grow more familiar and used to the task. In
the first place, the boat should be kept pumped out if she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
has a leak, as most boats have; next, her decks and cockpit
should be thoroughly scrubbed and kept as clean as
possible; the paint round the house and rails washed
regularly, and her topsides looked to at least once a week.</p>

<p>Next, keep good watch over the gear; don’t let the
ends of the ropes get fagged out; keep them whipped.
Always, after coming in from a sail, coil down and clear
up all the ends of the gear. Keep your rodes and warps
neatly coiled or Flemished, and not heaped in a tangled
mass, thrown in any way. Take up on your tackles so
that ropes don’t swing loose, but be careful not to take
up too hard, if you are not staying on the boat, because
if dampness or rain sets in the rope will absorb the
moisture and swell, causing it to contract and shrink
lengthways. This not only is bad for the cordage, but in
small vessels it frequently strains and distorts the spars.</p>

<p>If you have to leave your boat for several days with
no one to care for her, do not stow your sails too tightly;
roll them up loosely, and gasket so that they cannot
shake out if it comes on to blow. If sails are furled in
hard rolls the dampness in the canvas will cause them to
sweat and rot; canvas to keep good wants the air. Sail
covers are not good things to use, unless they are frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
removed, so as to let the air and sun get at the
sails.</p>

<p>If your boat is rigged with metal blocks, turnbuckles,
etc., these should be frequently oiled and greased, as
should also the gooseneck and the jaws of the gaff.
By keeping rust and verdigris off the working parts
of these things you will increase their length of service
and always have them in good working order. The steering
gear, if you use a wheel, should be frequently inspected
and oiled. If you use a tiller see that it is in
good condition and not split or weakened where it is
attached to the head of the rudder post. Steering gear
accidents are more frequent than any others, and sometimes
lead to disagreeable consequences.</p>

<p>The chain plates, and the shrouds where they go over
the mast should be looked at, and also the bobstay and
other headgear. Make a practice of going over your
rigging at least once a week during the season, and you
will be less likely to meet with any mishaps or accidents
through something unexpectedly giving way.</p>

<p>Nothing looks better or reflects more credit on a
young yacht sailor than to have his boat from truck to
keel in first-class order. It is a certain sign that he understands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
his business, takes an interest in sport, and is a
thorough and skilled sailorman. Of course, he cannot
if he only spends, say, two days out of the week on board
keep the boat up to the highest notch of completeness
and order as a yacht is kept that carries a professional
crew, but he can keep her neat and clean by giving a
few hours of his time to the task. But to make the work
easy let him refrain from covering his deck with brass or
other fancy gewgaws. Stick to things that don’t need
polishing; the less brass the less work.</p>

<p>Another thing I would point out to you, and that is,
when painting the decks or cockpit of a boat do not use
light-colored paints. One reason for this is that a light
color shows every speck of dirt and never can be made
to look clean, especially if the boat is harbored in places
where the water is muddy or dirty; the other reason is
that light paint reflects the sun and is very trying on the
eyes. For cockpit, decks and the top of cabin houses,
use a dark shade of green, grey or slate; green is the
best for the eyes.</p>

<h2><a name="MANEUVERS" id="MANEUVERS"></a>MANEUVERS</h2>


<p class="small-caption">To tack:</p>

<p>When ready to tack first put the helm up slightly
so as to give the boat a good full, then put it down
slowly and steadily. As the vessel’s bow comes into the
wind, right the helm, and then as she falls off catch her
with the helm before she gets too far away from the
wind. If the water is rough and the boat shows an
inclination to miss-stay, give her a good full, slacking
the sheet slightly to help her get headway, then as you
put the helm down, haul in smartly on the sheet.</p>


<p class="small-caption">To tack a sloop:</p>

<p>A sloop or any rig carrying headsails can be tacked
as follows: When ready to go about, ease the jib sheet,
putting down the helm at the same time; as the boat’s
head comes into the wind, haul in the same sheet that
you just eased, so as to get that sail aback; as she swings
off slack the weather sheet and haul aft the lee one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>


<p class="small-caption">To tack a yawl:</p>

<p>Proceed same as for tacking a sloop, but to aid her
haul dead-flat the mizzen before putting the helm down.
In a light air and a lob of sea when a yawl refuses to
go round, you can sometimes cause her to stay by lighting
up the jib and hauling the mizzen boom up on the
weather side.</p>


<p class="small-caption">Tacking small boats:</p>

<p>Small open boats such as dingeys and skiffs which
are slow at staying can be materially helped by moving
the weight of the crew forward as they come to the
wind, and again aft as they fall off.</p>


<p class="small-caption">Miss-staying:</p>

<p>Our modern yachts unlike the old fashioned kind
seldom miss-stay, except when attempted to tack in a
heavy seaway. The cause of miss-staying is generally
either carelessness or haste. Always give the boat a
good full and have way on her before you put the helm
down. If a boat miss-stay and get in irons do not jam
the helm hard over, but keep it amidship until she
gathers stern-way then move it over slowly. Remember
that the helm when a boat is going stern first acts the
opposite to what it does when she is going ahead. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
a centerboard boat pull up the board. If she still
refuses to fill, drop the peak.</p>


<p class="small-caption">To wear:</p>

<p>Wearing or veering is the opposite of tacking. In
a heavy sea when there is danger of a boat miss-staying
it is better to wear. To wear, get your sheet in flat,
then put the helm up slowly and as she pays-off, ease
the sheet gradually. To wear a yawl ease off the mizzen,
keep the mainsail flat, and haul the jib a-weather. In a
centerboard boat haul up the board. In a catboat if she
refuse to wear drop the peak.</p>


<p class="small-caption">To anchor:</p>

<p>The one prime rule of anchoring is never to let go
the anchor until the boat has stopped going ahead and
is beginning to go sternwards. In this way you prevent
the anchor being turned over, and brought foul of
the hawser. Always give an anchor plenty of line or
scope as it is called. Six times the depth of water is
sufficient under ordinary conditions. In bad weather
give all you can spare.</p>


<p class="small-caption">To get underway:</p>

<p>If at anchor before making sail heave in short on
your hawser or chain, but be careful not to take in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
enough to trip the hook, then cast loose and hoist the
sail, when ready heave in and break the anchor out of
the bottom.</p>


<p class="small-caption">To cast:</p>

<p>To cast a vessel is to turn her head from an anchorage
or mooring so as to make her go off on a chosen
tack. This is sometimes necessary when anchored between
other vessels or close to shore. Supposing it is
necessary in order to clear to take the port tack: Haul
your mainsail over to starboard, putting your helm the
same way. This wall cause her to make a sternboard
and her bow will fall off to port. A surer way if at a
mooring is to pass a light line to the buoy; carry this
aft outside of the rigging to the starboard quarter, then
let go the mooring warp and haul in on the spring line.
This will cause her head to pay off to port; when on the
course let go the spring. To cast her to starboard reverse
these proceedings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="RULES_OF_THE_ROAD" id="RULES_OF_THE_ROAD"></a>RULES OF THE ROAD</h2>


<p>The rules of the road are the rules governing the
movements of vessels when underway. They are laws
enacted by an agreement between all maritime nations,
and obedience to them is compulsory. If in case of a
collision, it is proved that one of the parties has violated
a rule of the road, the damages lie against the violator.
Yachtsmen should thoroughly learn and understand these
rules, and should always maintain and obey them.</p>

<p>A <em>steam vessel</em> is any vessel propelled by machinery&mdash;this
includes naphtha, gasolene, kerosene and electric
launches.</p>

<p>A <em>sailing vessel</em> is a vessel wholly propelled by sails.</p>

<p>An <em>auxiliary</em> yacht when using her engines, no matter
whether she has sail set or not is a <em>steam vessel</em>. If not
using her engine she is a sailing vessel.</p>

<p>Steam vessels must keep out of the way of sailing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
vessels; sailing vessels must keep out of the way of row-boats.</p>

<p>Vessels of all kinds, when underway, must keep clear
of anchored craft or craft lying idle or hove-to.</p>

<p>Overtaking vessels must keep clear of vessels overtaken.
A sailing vessel overtaking a launch must keep
clear of the launch.</p>

<p>When two sailing vessels are approaching one another,
so as to involve risk of collision, one of them shall keep
out of the way of the other as follows:</p>

<p>A vessel which is running free shall keep out of the
way of a vessel which is close-hauled.</p>

<p>A vessel which is close-hauled on the port tack shall
keep out of the way of a vessel which is close-hauled on
the starboard tack.</p>

<p>When both are running free, with the wind on
different sides, the vessel which has the wind on the port
side shall keep out of the way of the other.</p>

<p>When both are running free, with the wind on the
same side, the vessel which is to the windward shall
keep out of the way of the vessel which is to the leeward.</p>

<p>A vessel which has the wind aft shall keep out of the
way of the other vessel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>


<h3>Running Lights.</h3>

<p>A sailing vessel, when running at night, carries a
green light on her starboard side, and a red light on her
port side. Such lights are generally carried in the rigging,
about six feet above the rail.</p>

<p>A rowboat must carry a white light in a lantern to
show when in danger of being run down.</p>

<p>A steam vessel carries the same lights as a sailing
vessel, with the addition of a white light at the foremast
head, or on launches on top of the pilot house.</p>

<p>A steam vessel, when towing another vessel, carries
two white lights; if she is towing more than one vessel,
tandem fashion, she shall carry three white lights.</p>


<h3>Anchor Lights.</h3>

<p>A vessel when at anchor must keep burning a white
light, throwing an unbroken flare in every direction; this
light should be hoisted above the deck the height of the
vessel’s breadth.</p>

<p>All lights must be carried from sunset to sunrise; no
other lights should be shown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>


<h3>Fog Signals.</h3>

<p>A steam vessel must be provided with a whistle
operated by steam or air.</p>

<p>A sailing vessel must be provided with a horn.</p>

<p>In fog, mist, falling snow, or heavy rainstorms,
whether by day or night, the signals described shall be
used:</p>

<p>A steam vessel underway shall sound, at intervals of
not more than one minute, a prolonged blast.</p>

<p>A sailing vessel underway shall sound, at intervals of
not more than one minute, when on the starboard tack,
one blast; when on the port tack, two blasts in succession,
and when with the wind abaft the beam, three blasts in
succession.</p>

<p>A vessel when at anchor shall, at intervals of not
more than one minute, ring the bell rapidly for about five
seconds.</p>

<p>A steam vessel when towing shall, instead of the
signal prescribed above, at intervals of not more than one
minute, sound three blasts in succession, namely, one prolonged
blast followed by two short blasts. A vessel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
towed may give this signal and she shall not give any
other.</p>

<p>All rafts or other water craft, not herein provided for,
navigating by hand power, horse-power, or by the current
of the river, shall sound a blast of the fog horn, or equivalent
signal, at intervals of not more than one minute.</p>


<h3>Steam Vessel Signals.</h3>

<p><em>One blast</em>&mdash;I am directing my course to starboard.</p>

<p><em>Two blasts</em>&mdash;I am directing my course to port.</p>

<p><em>Three blasts</em>&mdash;I am going astern.</p>

<p>The vessel that blows first has the right of way.</p>

<p>Passing through narrow channels a vessel must keep
to that bank of the fairway which is on her starboard
hand.</p>

<p class="ad-header">THE RUDDER</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> policy of <span class="smcap">The Rudder</span> is to give to yachtsmen
a thoroughly practical periodical, dealing
with the sport of yachting in all its phases,
and especially to furnish them with the designs
and plans of vessels adapted to their wants
in all localities.</p>

<p style="font-size: smaller;">In each issue is a design of a sailing or power craft, and at least four
times a year a complete set of working drawings is given, so that the unskilled
can try a hand at building with a certainty of making a success of
the attempt.</p>

<p style="font-size: smaller;">In the last two years over 500 boats have been built from designs
printed in the magazine, and in almost every case have given satisfaction.</p>

<p style="font-size: smaller;">Outside of the strictly practical, the magazine has always a cargo of
readable things in the way of cruises and tales, while its illustrations are noted
for their novelty and beauty.</p>

<p style="font-size: smaller;">The editor desires to increase the size of the magazine and to add to its
features. In order to do this it is necessary that it be given the hearty support
of all who are interested in the sport. The cost of a subscription, $2 a year
rolled or $2.50 mailed flat, is as low as it is possible to make it and furnish a
first-class publication, and he asks yachtsmen to subscribe, as in that way
they can materially assist him in keeping the magazine up to its present
standard of excellence.</p>

interesting way. The chapters on anchors alone is worth more

<p style="text-indent: 0; font-size: smaller;">This little book, a very clever abridgement and complication of the heavier works of several
authorities, is one that has had quite an extensive sale, and has met with universal approval.
It is very clearly and very carefully written, and the explanations of the problems are
so lucid that no man should be forgiven who fails to understand them. I have seen many
books of this kind intended for beginners, but to my mind this is the best of the lot, and
I recommend it to those who are anxious to study navigation.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Editor of The Rudder.</span></p>
